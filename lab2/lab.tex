\normalpage{Specification}{
This program will read in a list of cities from a file and store them
in a Linked List. The program will have different methods to manipulate 
the list including traversing and destroying. Document the process with diagrams. 
}
\normalpage{Analysis}{
\qi{Inputs: File with names of cities in random order.}
\qi{Process: Read this cities from the file into a list using functions 
loadList, loadListInOrder, and buildDirectly. The list is printed then 
destroyed before calling the next load function }
\qi{Outputs: Display the list in each of the 3 different methods
used to build it.}
}
\normalpage{Design}{
\qi{node: structure for the Nodes}
\qi{sll: structure for the single linked list including member functions}
\qi{insert: insert city into front of list}
\qi{insertInOrder: insert city in alphabetical order}
\qi{buildDirectly: insert city in the order of the cities.dat file}
\qi{displayList: prints out the list to the console}
\qi{destroyList: deletes each node in the list}
\qi{loadList: opens the file passed in and builds a list using insert}
\qi{loadListInOrder: opens the file passed in and build a list using inserInOrder}
\qi{buildDirectly: opens the file passed in and builds a list using buildDirectly}
\qi{main: the main function creates a SLL and passes it to the load functions}
}

\normalpage{Implementation: lab.h File}{
This header file includes the three load functions required by the program 
along with various included libraries.
\VerbatimInput{lab.h}
}

\normalpage{Implementation: node.h File}{
This header file includes the structure for the node structure. The node
has 2 data elements: the city, and the next pointer. There is also a 
constructor for quicker initialization of the data.
\VerbatimInput{node.h}
}

\normalpage{Implementation: sll.h File}{
This is the header file for the single linked list structure. The sll only
has two data element which is the head pointer and the tail pointer. 
This file also includes the declarations for member functions used 
to manipulate the list.
\VerbatimInput{sll.h}
}

\normalpage{Implementation: insert.cpp File}{
This is the insert member function for SLL. It takes in a string as the
city name. First it checks if it is an empty list and if it is, it will set
that city as the head of the list.  If there are nodes in the list, it will
set the new cities next pointer to the current head node. Then it will set
the head to the new actual head of the list. A list built with this 
method will be in reverse order.

\normalpage{Implementation: insertInOrder.cpp File}{
This is the insert member function that will insert the new city in 
alphabatical order. This function uses a pointer to a Node pointer and 
traverse the list by following the pointers rather than the Nodes. The
list will be in alphabetical order.

\normalpage{Implementation: buildDirectly.cpp File}{
This member function of the SLL struct will build the list using a tail 
pointer. This function is passed in the city and create a new node. 
It will set the current tail node to this new node.
The tail will then be set to the new node added.

\normalpage{Implementation: displayList.cpp File}{
This method is used to print the cities to the console. It checks to see
if the list is not empty. If the list is not empty, it will start at the 
head and print out its city element. Then it will follow the link of pointers
to traverse the list.
\VerbatimInput{displayList.cpp}
}

\normalpage{Implementation: destroyList.cpp File}{
This method is used to destroy the list by deleting every node in the list.
Using a temp pointer to hold the remaining portion of the list, the function
deletes the first node until there is none left. Finally it sets the head to
nullptr.
\VerbatimInput{destroyList.cpp}
}

\normalpage{Implementation: loadList.cpp File}{
This function takes in a file name and a pointer to a list. The function
opens the file cities.dat, returning false if it fails. If successful, 
the function will read in each line from the file and call the insert 
member function of the list. Finally it returns true if it is successful.
\VerbatimInput{loadList.cpp}
}

\normalpage{Implementation: loadListInOrder.cpp File}{
This function opens and reads from file the same as the loadList function.
loadListInOrder calls the insertInOrder function rather than the insert function.
\VerbatimInput{loadListInOrder.cpp}
}

\normalpage{Implementation: loadListDirectly.cpp File}{
This function is same as the other two loadList functions with the only
difference being that this one calls the buildDirectly function.
\VerbatimInput{loadListDirectly.cpp}
}

\normalpage{Implementation: lab.cpp File}{
This is the main function. It first creates a new SLL and then passes it 
to the loadList function. If the list is succesfully created, displayList 
will be called. The list is then destroyed by calling destroyList, and the
list is rebuilt using the next method. When the list is built and destroyed
with all 3 methods, the SLL is deleted and the program ends.
\VerbatimInput{lab.cpp}
}

\normalpage{Test}{
Test case that shows the three results. Insert should result in a list 
in the inverse as the cities.dat file. Insert in order should return
a list that is in alphabetical order. Build Directly should give a list
in the opposite order of the Insert method which will be the same order
as the cities.dat file.
